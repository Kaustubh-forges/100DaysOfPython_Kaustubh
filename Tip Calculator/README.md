# üé§ Tip Calculator Project | Day 2- 100 Days of Python

## A simple, interactive calculator that splits a bill among a group of people, including a chosen percentage of tip for the service

### üìñ**What It Teaches**
 - How to round upto a certain decimal point using `round()`
 - How to format and present without chaos using `f-string`
 - Displaying the use of arithmetic operations such as `+`,`*`,`/`

### ‚ùì**How Is It Run**

1. Open a terminal  
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 100DaysOfPython_Kaustubh/"Tip Calculator"
   python Tip_Calculator.py
   ```
3. You can also run the code in an IDLE such as Visual Studio Code or PyCharm

### üíª **Sample Output**
```
Welcome to the Tip Calculator!
What was the total bill? $555
What percentage tip would you like to give? 10%, 12%, or 15%? 12
How many people to split the bill? 3
Each person should pay: $207.2

```

### üôè **Credits**
This project is part of my journey through the 
[100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu.  

The project idea comes from the course, but the code and documentation here are my own work.  
At times I referenced the course material when stuck, and in some cases my solution may look very similar to the course‚Äôs ‚Äî simply because there are only a few straightforward ways to solve certain beginner problems.  
Either way, the implementation reflects my own understanding and learning process.
