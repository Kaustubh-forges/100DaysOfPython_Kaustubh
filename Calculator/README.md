## A uncomplicated calculator program that performs mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

### **What It Teaches**
 - How to use functions to perform various tasks
 - How `return` keyword works
 - How the function terminates after return statement

### ❓**How Is It Run**

1. Open a terminal  
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 100DaysOfPython_Kaustubh/Calculator
   python Calculator.py
   ```
3. You can also run the code in an IDLE such as Visual Studio Code or PyCharm

### 💻 **Sample Output**
```
Enter the first number: 44
Enter the second number: 333
Enter the operation(+,-,*,/): +


The final result: 377
```

### 🙏 **Credits**
This project is part of my journey through the 
[100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu.  

The project idea comes from the course, but the code and documentation here are my own work.  
At times I referenced the course material when stuck, and in some cases my solution may look very similar to the course’s — simply because there are only a few straightforward ways to solve certain beginner problems.  
Either way, the implementation reflects my own understanding and learning process.
