# 🔢Guess The Number Game Project | Day 12- 100 Days of Python

## An engaging game where you have to guess the number correctly. Don't worry, there is an easy version for you newbies... we both know you need it😜

### **What It Teaches**
 - How to return a list from a function (Angela did something else entirely, but I felt my way was rather… effective — if not unconventional)
 - Angela taught a couple of new concepts today(Global constants and variables), but in the spirit of brain cells' conservation(and you know, time), I completed this project with previously learned concepts

### ❓**How Is It Run**

1. Open a terminal  
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 100DaysOfPython_Kaustubh/Guess_The_Number
   python Guess_The_Number.py
   ```
3. You can also run the code in an IDLE such as Visual Studio Code or PyCharm

### 💻 **Sample Output**
```
          
You have 9 chances left to guess the number.
Guess your number: 77
Too Low
Guess again

```

### 🙏 **Credits**
This project is part of my journey through the 
[100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu.  

The project idea comes from the course, but the code and documentation here are my own work.  
At times I referenced the course material when stuck, and in some cases my solution may look very similar to the course’s — simply because there are only a few straightforward ways to solve certain beginner problems.  
Either way, the implementation reflects my own understanding and learning process.
