# 👨‍🎤Higher or lower Game Project | Day 14- 100 Days of Python

## A tiny project to test how celebrity-savvy you really are. Get one wrong, and find yourself despairing over your not-so-good knowledge of celebrity instagram handles

### **What It Teaches**
 - No new concepts were taught on this day. This project was made using previously grasped concepts
 
### ❓**How Is It Run**

1. Open a terminal  
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 100DaysOfPython_Kaustubh/Higher_or_Lower
   python Higher_or_Lower.py
   ```
3. You can also run the code in an IDLE such as Visual Studio Code or PyCharm

### 🙏 **Credits**
This project is part of my journey through the 
[100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu.  

The project idea comes from the course, but the code and documentation here are my own work.  
At times I referenced the course material when stuck, and in some cases my solution may look very similar to the course’s — simply because there are only a few straightforward ways to solve certain beginner problems.  
Either way, the implementation reflects my own understanding and learning process.
