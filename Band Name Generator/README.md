# 🎤 Band Name Generator Project | Day 1- 100 Days of Python

## A simple, interactive program that combines your pet's name and your city to produce a *band* name for you

### **What It Teaches**
 - How to use `print()` and `input()` in Python
 - How to perform String Concatenation(join two strings)
 - Storing user-entered data into a variable

### ❓**How Is It Run**

1. Open a terminal  
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 100DaysOfPython_Kaustubh/"Band Name Generator"
   python Band_Name_Generator.py
   ```
3. You can also run the code in an IDLE such as Visual Studio Code or PyCharm

### 💻 **Sample Output**
```
Welcome to the Band Name Generator.
What's the name of the city you grew up in?
Cambridge
What's your pet's name?
Henry
Your band name could be Cambridge Henry
```

This project is part of my journey through the 
[100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu.  

The project idea comes from the course, but the code and documentation here are my own work.  
At times I referenced the course material when stuck, and in some cases my solution may look very similar to the course’s — simply because there are only a few straightforward ways to solve certain beginner problems.  
Either way, the implementation reflects my own understanding and learning process.
