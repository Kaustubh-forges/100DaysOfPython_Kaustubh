# 🐍 100 Days of Python – Kaustubh's Journey with a lack of tranquility 

This repository is my personal log of projects and exercises from the  
[100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu.  

Each folder corresponds to a small project I’ve completed,  
and most projects include their own **README** file with details, sample outputs,  
and what I learned from building them.


## 🚀 Big Projects (separate repositories)

The larger and more complex projects in the course have their own dedicated repositories:  

- 🏓 [Pong Arcade Game](https://github.com/Kaustubh-forges/Pong-Arcade.git) - Classic Pong arcade game in Python with Turtle graphics.

-------------

## 🎯 Goals
- Document my progress through the 100 days of Python Bootcamp.
- Share beginner-friendly projects with clear mention of concepts learned in each project.
- Track my growth as a developer.
- Use the repository as a source of motivation and a mark of diligence.

The course provides the structure and project ideas.<br>
All the code, documentation, repository work is a reflection of my own work;<br>
the skills showcased are the result of gradual knowledge consumption as a learner.
