# üí∞ Treasure Island Game  Project | Day 3- 100 Days of Python

## A simple, interactive and fun game that takes the user on a silly little text-based hunt for treasure

### üìñ**What It Teaches**
 - How to use `if`,`else`, and `elif` conditions to steer outcome based on user input
 - How to use ASCII art for improved aesthetics
 - How to branch conditional statements together
 - How to convert a string to raw string literal using `r-string` to prevent `\` getting interpreted as `\n` or `\t`
### ‚ùì**How Is It Run**

1. Open a terminal  
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 100DaysOfPython_Kaustubh/Treasure-Island
   python Treasure_Island.py
   ```
3. You can also run the code in an IDLE such as Visual Studio Code or PyCharm

### üíª **Sample Output**

### üôè **Credits**
This project is part of my journey through the 
[100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu.  

The project idea comes from the course, but the code and documentation here are my own work.  
At times I referenced the course material when stuck, and in some cases my solution may look very similar to the course‚Äôs ‚Äî simply because there are only a few straightforward ways to solve certain beginner problems.  
Either way, the implementation reflects my own understanding and learning process.
