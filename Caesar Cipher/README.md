# üî°Caesar Cipher Project | Day 8- 100 Days of Python

## A clever project that hides messages by shifting letters, like sending and receiving secret codes the ancient roman wayüìú

### **What It Teaches**
 - How to create `user-defined` functions
 - How to call `user-defined` functions
 - How to use `index()` to access the index of an element
 - How to use `break` to break out of a loop
 - How to use `%` to find the remainder

### ‚ùì**How Is It Run**

1. Open a terminal  
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 100DaysOfPython_Kaustubh/"Caesar Cipher"
   python Caesar_Cipher.py
   ```
3. You can also run the code in an IDLE such as Visual Studio Code or PyCharm

### üíª **Sample Output**

              88
              88

Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
encode
Type your message:
Tom is here
Type the shift number:
2
The encoded result is vqo ku jgtg.
Type 'yes' if you want to go again. Otherwise, type 'no'
```

### üôè **Credits**
This project is part of my journey through the 
[100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu.  

The project idea comes from the course, but the code and documentation here are my own work.  
At times I referenced the course material when stuck, and in some cases my solution may look very similar to the course‚Äôs ‚Äî simply because there are only a few straightforward ways to solve certain beginner problems.  
Either way, the implementation reflects my own understanding and learning process.
