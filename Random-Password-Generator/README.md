# 🔑Random Password Generator Project | Day 5- 100 Days of Python

## An effective program to improve security with randomly generated passwords made up of letters, numbers, and symbols

### **What It Teaches**
 - How to use `lists` to store individual characters
 - How to iterate through a `list` using a range-based `for` loop
 - How to push elements to the end of a `list` using `append()`
 - How to use `shuffle()` to randomize the order of elements in a list
 - How to loop through a `list` and present it in text format

### ❓**How Is It Run**

1. Open a terminal  
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 100DaysOfPython_Kaustubh/Random-Password-Generator
   python Password-Generator.py
   ```
3. You can also run the code in an IDLE such as Visual Studio Code or PyCharm

### 💻 **Sample Output**
```
Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!
How many letters would you like in your password?
5
How many symbols would you like?
4
How many numbers would you like?
4
Your generated password: s0!5PV$p7#%O5
```

### 🙏 **Credits**
This project is part of my journey through the 
[100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu.  

The project idea comes from the course, but the code and documentation here are my own work.  
At times I referenced the course material when stuck, and in some cases my solution may look very similar to the course’s — simply because there are only a few straightforward ways to solve certain beginner problems.  
Either way, the implementation reflects my own understanding and learning process.
